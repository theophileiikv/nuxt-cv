    description: |
      At Technofy, I managed a diverse delivery team of DevOps, SecOps, Front-End, Back-End, and UI/UX experts. Our goal was to deliver high-quality products to customers on time. I oversaw large AWS projects, including network automation, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, DNS, and building new products from scratch.
      
      To keep everyone on the same page, I led Agile meetings like standups, planning sessions, demos, and retrospectives. I made sure the right people were working on the right tasks and that we had the resources to meet our deadlines. We followed Agile methods, learning and making changes quickly based on feedback.
      
      I worked closely with clients to understand their needs and turn them into clear user stories for the team. From start to finish, I planned and managed the delivery process, kept customers informed, and made sure we had all the necessary documentation.
      
      Listening to customers was a big part of my job. I used their feedback to make our services better. Quality was always a top priority, and I made sure our products met the right standards for each stage of development.
